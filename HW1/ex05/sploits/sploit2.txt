This attack is a trickier buffer overflow than sploit 1.
Here, we can also do a buffer overflow but only at the last iteration in the `for` loop.
Hence, only 1 byte can be overwritten, it is first one of `ebp`.
As usual, we start to fill our buffer attack with NOP to make the address return easier.
The attack is such that when the function `nstrcpy` return, `ebp` will have been modified.
Modified such that when `bar` terminate and reach for its `ret` pointer, it returns in fact to the middle of our NOP sled.
Again, the shellcode is at the end of the NOP sled :)
