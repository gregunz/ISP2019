This attack is a trickier than the buffer overflow in sploit 1.
Here, we can also do a buffer overflow but only at the last iteration in the `for` loop (`<=` instead of `<`).
Hence, only 1 byte can be overwritten, it is first one of `ebp`.
As usual, we start to fill our buffer attack with NOP to make the address return easier.
The attack is such that when the function `nstrcpy` return, `ebp` will have been modified.
Modified such that when `bar` terminate and reach for its `ret` pointer, it in fact reaches a modified `ret` which itself points to the middle of our NOP sled.
(using gdb): (to know how to change the first byte, we first locate where is the modified `ret`, and hopefully it only differs in the first byte)
Again, the shellcode is put at the end of the NOP sled :)
